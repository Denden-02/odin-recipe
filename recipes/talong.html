        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p> This dish is basically a savory cake that is deep-fried to crispy perfection. Now our grated eggplants and chopped green onions add some more exciting texture to the mix. And of course, to ensure that we get something that's satisfyingly salty, we also season this with some salt and ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>This can also be referred to as the vegetable version of Shrimp Ukoy (okoy).</p>
